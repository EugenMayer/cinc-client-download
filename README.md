# WAT

1:1 binary mirror for downloads of [cincs mirror](http://downloads.cinc.sh/files/stable/cinc/) - yet only for debian.

The reason is, that the mentioned site has a download speed of 50-150kb/s, which really slows down all `kitchen` tests and production deployments, since each of the cinc
binaries are about 45mb.

Be sure to use the checksum agains the original - of course the one here SHOULD / MUST be unchanged.
